    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. 
    Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a 
    mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute the balsamic 
    vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16oz spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1lb lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tins crushed tomato</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato puree</li>
        <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the 
            spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 
            about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the 
            oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and 
            oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to 
            soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 
            about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook 
            and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer 
            until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes, 
            tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; bring the mixture to 
            a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir the 
            fresh basil into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to 
            serve.</li>
    </ol>
