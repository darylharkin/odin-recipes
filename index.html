    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <div>Welcome to Odin Recipes. Your one stop shop for recipes I've ripped off <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">allrecipes.com</a></div>
    <div class="disclaimer">Odin Recipes takes no responsibility for illnesses or discomforts
        experienced after eating recipes herein.</div>
    <p>I have included precisely one breakfast, one lunch and one dinner. What
        more could you need?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="recipes/spagbol.html">Spaghetti Bolognese</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/grilledcheese.html">Grilled Cheese</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/pancakes.html">Pancakes</a></li>
    </ul> 
    <div id="alternatives">If you require recipes for an extra meal in the day, such as 
        elevenses, or if you want to eat differently from day to day, I suggest
        googling "meal ideas" or somesuch. This site only really exists as a css
        sandbox.
